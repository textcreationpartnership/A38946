            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Exact <hi>RELATION</hi> of Routing the <hi>Iriſh Army</hi> under <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> and of the Hoſtages agreed on, in order to a Capitulation for <hi>Surrender of Limerick <hi>into</hi>
               </hi> Their Majeſties Hands.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>Friday</hi> the ſecond Inſtant, we had Letters of 22d <hi>September,</hi> from the Camp before <hi>Limerick,</hi> with Advice, That on the Nineteenth the Great Cannon for Battery having done their deſigned office, were ordered from off the Batteries and carried down to be put on Board the Ships in the River, and Orders given to the Commanders of all the whole Squadron, forthwith to deſtroy and bring off all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Corn, Forrage, Proviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they could come at all along the <hi>Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> on <hi>Clare</hi> ſide, in order to ſtreighten the Town, which had all its ſupport from that County, and the County of <hi>Kerry;</hi> which latter, Brigadier <hi>Leviſton</hi> had already ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that moſt of the conſiderable Inhabitants had taken Protection from him, and but a few days before had routed the main Body the Enemy had in that County, which conſiſted of two Regiments of Horſe, and of Foot and Rapparees, near Three thouſand.</p>
            <p>Things ſtanding thus, a Council of War was called, and a Reſolution taken to paſs over the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and reduce <hi>Clare,</hi> or fight <hi>Sarsfield.</hi> And purſuant hereunto, the General diſpoſed all things proper in the Camp.</p>
            <p>And on Tueſday the Twenty ſecond of <hi>September</hi> early in the Morning, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Prince of <hi>Wirtemburgh,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> General <hi>Sravenmore, &amp;c.</hi> with Ten Regiments of Foot, Fourteen Field-pieces, Eight days Subſiſtence, and all the Horſe and Dragoons, (excepting Collonel <hi>Coys</hi> Regiment, and Fifty from out each Regiment that marcht) marched over the Bridge of Pontoons into the ſaid County of <hi>Clare.</hi> The Enemy during their March to the ſaid Bridge, not ſparing their Cannon Ball.</p>
            <p>The ſame Letters gave us an account, that the Town was extream ſhort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and could not ſubſiſt Ten days, and were much divided in their Reſolutions; as alſo that after the Defeat of their Four Regiments of Dragoons, Commanded by Brigadeer <hi>Clifford</hi> a few days before, and <hi>Sarsfield</hi> Decamping towards the Mountains with their whole Body. They were within for a Surrender, and on the brink of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, of which advice being Convoyed to <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> he in the Night threw himſelf into the Town with a great Body of Horſe, ſome ſay 1500, deſigning to watch our draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and to Sally upon our Reer.</p>
            <p>The General left before the Town Major General <hi>Maccay,</hi> Major General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> and a ſufficient ſtrength to ſecure the Works and Trenches againſt all the Force could come againſt them, and orders to continue (as they had done before) night and day without intermiſſion to Play upon the Town, which our Camp expected would have made a vigorous Sally the 23 or 24th. but they had not the Courage ſo to do, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced by <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> of whoſe coming in we had no intelligence.</p>
            <p>On Sunday Morning <hi>October</hi> the fourth, an Eminent Citizen who hath been very happy and early in his Intelligence from <hi>Ireland,</hi> waited on Her Majeſty with Three Letters from perſons of known Reputation and Integrity, which give the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>viz.</hi> That the General and Army marched up into the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> to find out the Enemy, and on the 23 met with them, Commanded in Chief by <hi>Dominick Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> and others, who took their March towards <hi>Limerick;</hi> the General followed them hard, and on the 24 not far from <hi>Limerick,</hi> fought and beat them killing 600 on the place, and took 300 priſoners, amongſt which are one Collonel, three Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonels, fifteen Majors, 22 Captains, and divers Subaltern Officers.</p>
            <p>The routed Enemy fled to <hi>Limerick</hi> over the <hi>Shannon-Bridge,</hi> and our Men purſued them ſo cloſe, that many went in with them; and had not the Governour ſhut <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>-Gate, our whole Army had fell in Pel-mel into the Town, and taken it by Storm.</p>
            <p>By the Governour's ſhutting the Gate, and drawing up the Bridge, many of the Enemy were ſhut out, and left to the Mercy of our Men; which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> within ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forced (as its thought) the Governour to hang out a White Flag.</p>
            <p>And immediately a Centinel was ſent into our Camp to Major-General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> to know on which ſide General <hi>Ginkle</hi> was, in order to a Capitulation; and forthwith a Lieutenant-Collonel from our Camp, and a Lieutenant-Collonel from our Governour, were ſent on <hi>Clare</hi> ſide to the General, to acquaint him therewith: who in a little time conſented thereto; and the Hoſtages were agreed on, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Town, <hi>Sarsfield</hi> and <hi>Wahoup;</hi> and for the General, the Prince of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and Major-General <hi>Scravenmore;</hi> who were immediately exchanged accordingly.</p>
            <p>So that we may reaſonably believe, the next News from <hi>Ireland</hi> will be an Expreſs from the General, with the Articles and Day of Surrender: Which will put an end to that War, and determine the many Wagers depending on <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Day; before which, or on that day, its thought the Capitulation will put it into Their Majeſties Hands. <hi>Whom GOD grant long to Reign.</hi>
